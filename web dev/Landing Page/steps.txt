the steps to run the ReactJS and NodeJS in a single weather app demo:

Open two terminal windows or tabs and navigate to the project folder.
In one of the terminal windows, navigate to the client folder by running cd client.
Start the ReactJS application by running npm start. This will start the development server and open a new tab in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.
In the other terminal window, navigate to the server folder by running cd ../server (assuming you are still inside the client folder in the first terminal window).
Start the NodeJS server by running node index.js. This will start the server on http://localhost:4000.
Now, you should be able to access the weather app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Enter the latitude and longitude of the location you want to get the weather for and click on the "Get Weather" button.
The ReactJS application will make a request to the NodeJS server, which will in turn make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data for that location.
Once the weather data is received, the NodeJS server will send it back to the ReactJS application, which will update the UI with the weather information.
